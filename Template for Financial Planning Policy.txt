6. Investment Vehicle Selection

a. Display selected vehicles and its corresponding allocation

7. Risk Management
1) Establish performance measurement and reporting accountabilities.
2) Specify appropriate metrics for risk measurement and evaluation.

Example?
* Absolute Risk: The portfolio?s absolute risk is measured as the annualized standard deviation of simulated daily returns over the previous 250 business days. The absolute risk of the portfolio must remain within ñ2.5% of the agreed Strategic Asset Allocation (SAA) risk level (e.g., if the SAA portfolio risk is 7%, the actual portfolio risk must fall between 4.5% and 9.5% on an annualized basis). This threshold remains unchanged. 
* Tracking Error: The tracking error, calculated using the same methodology but based on relative returns, measures active risk against the SAA benchmark. The minimum tracking error constraint is increased to 2.5% versus the SAA, with a maximum of 7.5% on an annualized basis (approximately 3 times the prior thresholds). 
* Individual Asset Drawdown Trigger: If any individual asset or position drops more than 10% within a week, it will trigger an immediate forced sale to stabilize losses and prevent further drawdown. 
* Cost Constraints: Investment fees shall be limited, and any changes from the SAA fulfillment must not increase the portfolio?s total expense ratio or Ongoing Charges Ratio (OCR) by more than 75 basis points (0.75%) per annum. 
* Breach Response: If any of the predefined thresholds (absolute risk, tracking error, individual drawdown, or cost) are breached, the portfolio must be promptly adjusted?including forced sales where applicable?to bring it back within the agreed constraints. 
* No short selling, no margin financing. 
3) Define the process for rebalancing portfolios to target allocations.
