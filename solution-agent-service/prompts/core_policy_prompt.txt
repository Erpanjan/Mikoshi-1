Section requirements:
- sections must contain all 14 sections exactly in this order:
  1) Client Background
  2) Client Financial Snapshot
  3) Client Financial Needs
  4) Client Investment Preferences and Behavioral Considerations
  5) Taxes, Exclusions, and Exemptions
  6) Other Special Requirements
  7) Capital Deployment Timeline
  8) Portfolio Policy
  9) Investment Vehicle Selection Highlights
  10) Risk Management Framework
  11) Policy Evaluation Metrics
  12) Fee and Governance Notes
  13) Disclaimer and Acknowledgment
  14) Tool Execution Log
- For clients with multiple major expense items/goals, ring-fenced multi-portfolio planning is allowed.
- Capital Deployment Timeline (Section 7) governs the overall policy-level deployment plan.
- If ring-fencing is used, Section 8 ("Portfolio Policy") must clearly describe each portfolio's:
  - portfolio construction
  - contribution strategy
  - risk management approach
- If ring-fencing is used, sections must be written so each portfolio has corresponding content lines for:
  - 8) Portfolio Policy
  - 9) Investment Vehicle Selection Highlights
  - 10) Risk Management Framework
  - 11) Policy Evaluation Metrics
- If ring-fencing is not used, keep a single-portfolio policy.

Section 9 requirement:
- Section title must be exactly "Investment Vehicle Selection Highlights".
- Section 9 content must be a JSON string (no markdown) with schema:
  {"recommended_securities":[{"security_name":"string","asset_class":"string","allocation_pct":0.0,"allocation_amount":0.0,"management_style":"active|passive","security_id":"string"}]}
- Preserve provided securities from context when available.
- allocation_pct and allocation_amount must be numeric and internally consistent.
- Even when ring-fencing is used, keep Section 9 in this same single JSON schema (aggregate list).
- If ring-fencing is used, portfolio-to-security mapping and per-portfolio rationale must be explained in Sections 8, 10, and 11 text.

Consistency rules:
- policy_title and execution.remedy_name must describe the same policy.
- execution.funding_source must be exactly: "JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. — Account ending in XXX".
- portfolio.total_transfer must be numeric and non-null.
- Capital Deployment Timeline section must include one explicit numeric USD capital amount.
- portfolio.total_transfer, the deployment amount in Capital Deployment Timeline, and the sum of Section 9 allocation_amount values must be numerically consistent.
- If ring-fencing is used, all per-portfolio capital splits described in section text must sum to the same total as portfolio.total_transfer.

Output rules:
- Use stable section ids (for example s1..s14).
- Keep content specific and concise.
- Do not output any UI schema fields (no menu/detail/execution.total_transfer contract fields).
