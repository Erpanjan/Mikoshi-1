  "detail": {
    "title": "string",
    "sections": [
      {
        "id": "string",
        "title": "string",
        "content": "string"
      }
    ]
  },
  "execution": {
    "remedy_name": "string",
    "funding_source": "string",
    "total_transfer": "number|null"

- menu.summary is a menu-preview only:
  - Keep it concise (2-3 short sentences).
  - Focus only on core objective + primary strategy direction.
  - Avoid detailed modeling rationale, deep technical explanation, or long numeric breakdowns.
- execution.remedy_name must match menu.title.
- execution.funding_source must be exactly: "JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. — Account ending in XXX".
- execution.total_transfer must be numeric and non-null.
