# Financial Planning Policy — Option 1 (Sequential Goals)

**Client:** Sarah Chen  
**Date:** February 10, 2026  
**Primary Investment Focus:** House Purchase in 2033 ($10,000,000)  
**Secondary Investment Focus:** Retirement at 60 ($5,000,000)

---

## I. Client Background

Sarah Chen is 40 years old, plans to retire at 60, and has a life expectancy assumption of 90. She supports two dependents and is in her peak earning years. Her near‑term objective is to purchase a $10,000,000 home in 2033 while maintaining a $5,000,000 retirement target at age 60. This policy is structured as two sequentially managed objectives: first, secure the housing purchase from liquid assets; second, improve retirement growth after the home is purchased.

## II. Client Financial Snapshot

Sarah’s wealth is employment‑derived. She earns $300,000 per year with 3% annual growth and spends $150,000 in base costs plus $60,000 in rent, also rising at 3%. Her assets total approximately $6.7M, concentrated in a $5.0M brokerage account, a $1.0M 401(k), $500k in cash, and a $200k Roth IRA. Cashflow projections use forward‑looking capital market assumptions and account‑level allocations to estimate growth. Baseline projections show persistent negative net cashflow that gradually draws down liquid resources over time.

## III. Client Financial Needs

Sarah has two distinct needs that must be addressed in sequence.

**Housing need (primary, 2033):** The primary investment need is to accumulate $10,000,000 by 2033 from liquid assets (bank + brokerage + Roth IRA). After holding a six‑month emergency reserve of approximately $105,000, the investable base is approximately $5,595,000. Achieving $10,000,000 from $5,595,000 over 7 years requires an annualized return of approximately 8.65% before considering ongoing cashflow deficits and taxes. Under the current allocation, the liquid pool in 2033 is projected at $8,340,952, implying a $1,659,048 shortfall against the house target.

**Retirement need (secondary, 2046):** Retirement is intended to be funded from the 401(k). Under the baseline projection the 401(k) balance at 2046 is $4,474,753, implying a $525,247 shortfall versus the $5M target. Under the housing‑focused solution, the 401(k) balance at 2046 is projected at $2,794,527, implying a larger shortfall of $2,205,473. This is the trade‑off created by prioritizing the housing objective.

**Policy approach (Option 1):** Keep the housing strategy intact, then shift the retirement portfolio to a growth‑oriented allocation after the house purchase. This treats housing and retirement as sequential objectives, allowing near‑term liquidity to remain focused on the house while improving long‑term retirement outcomes after 2033.

**Housing goal result:** 2033 liquid assets increase to $9,660,213, reducing the house shortfall to approximately $339,787.

### Post‑House Retirement Projection (2033–2046)

After the house is purchased, the retirement portfolio is adjusted to improve long‑term growth. The table below shows the projected 401(k) balance from age 47 (year 2033) to age 60 (year 2046).

| Actual Year | Age | 401k Balance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2033 | 47 | $1,653,959 |
| 2034 | 48 | $1,808,092 |
| 2035 | 49 | $1,974,424 |
| 2036 | 50 | $2,161,285 |
| 2037 | 51 | $2,362,936 |
| 2038 | 52 | $2,580,547 |
| 2039 | 53 | $2,815,381 |
| 2040 | 54 | $3,068,801 |
| 2041 | 55 | $3,342,279 |
| 2042 | 56 | $3,637,401 |
| 2043 | 57 | $3,955,881 |
| 2044 | 58 | $4,299,567 |
| 2045 | 59 | $4,670,455 |
| 2046 | 60 | $5,070,697 |

**Retirement result (post‑2033 allocation):** The 401(k) is projected to reach approximately $5.07M by 2046 under the post‑house retirement allocation.

## IV. Client Investment Preference

Sarah’s current allocations show comfort with diversified global equity exposure, core fixed income, and modest alternatives. The recommendation reflects this preference with disciplined risk control for the housing objective and a growth‑oriented retirement allocation after 2033.

## V. Taxes, Exclusions and Exemptions

Tax status was not provided. This policy assumes U.S. residency and uses tax‑efficient implementation in the brokerage account. Interest‑heavy and higher‑turnover exposures should be tilted toward tax‑advantaged accounts where possible, while equities and tax‑efficient instruments are prioritized in taxable accounts. Any future tax‑residency changes should trigger a policy review.

## VI. Other Special Requirements

None provided.

## VII. Portfolio

### 1. Scope and Allocation Timeline

**Phase 1 (2026–2033, House Purchase):** The policy allocates the liquid pool (brokerage and Roth IRA balances plus cash above a six‑month reserve) to a risk‑controlled portfolio designed to meet the 2033 house goal. The investable amount is approximately $5,595,000, with $105,000 maintained in cash for liquidity. Deployment is phased over one to three months.

**Phase 2 (Post‑2033, Retirement Growth):** After the house purchase, the retirement (401(k)) portfolio shifts to a growth‑oriented allocation aimed at closing the retirement gap over the remaining horizon to age 60.

### 2. Governance

Investment policy is set by the advisor in consultation with Sarah, executed through the custodian, and reviewed quarterly. Annual policy reviews are required or sooner if Sarah’s goals, cashflow, or risk tolerance materially change. Asset allocation assumptions are grounded in forward‑looking capital market assumptions, and risk management accountability remains with the advisor.

### 3. Investment, Return, and Risk Objectives

**Housing portfolio objective:** Meet or exceed an 8.65% annualized return over seven years with controlled volatility. The recommended allocation targets an expected return of **8.68%** with **9.42%** volatility.

**Retirement portfolio objective (post‑2033):** Restore long‑term growth and close the retirement shortfall. The recommended allocation targets an expected return of **7.62%** with **7.93%** volatility based on the post‑house timeline.

### 4. Investment Guidelines

The portfolios must remain diversified across global equities, bonds, and alternatives, maintain at least a 2% cash allocation, and prohibit leverage or short selling. Rebalancing should occur at least annually, or earlier if any asset class drifts by more than 5 percentage points from target.

### 5. Investment Strategy

The strategy uses a risk‑controlled allocation for the housing goal, followed by a growth‑oriented retirement allocation after 2033. This preserves near‑term liquidity while improving the longer‑term retirement trajectory.

### 6. Investment Vehicle Selection

The recommended allocations provide asset‑class weights, a balanced mix of active and passive exposure, and implementable securities. The selection favors cost efficiency, liquidity, diversification, and ease of implementation while still allowing targeted active exposure where it is most justified. Active exposure is used where specialized manager skill and market inefficiencies can reasonably add value; passive exposure is used where broad market exposure and low cost are the primary goals.

### 7. Risk Management

Risk oversight is defined in clear, measurable terms to keep the portfolios aligned with their objectives.

**Housing portfolio — absolute risk.** Annualized standard deviation of simulated daily returns over the most recent 250 business days. Target volatility 9.42%, acceptable range 6.92%–11.92%. Breaches require rebalancing.

**Retirement portfolio — absolute risk.** Target volatility 7.93%, acceptable range 5.43%–10.43%. Breaches require rebalancing.

**Tracking error.** For both portfolios, tracking error versus the policy benchmark must remain between 2.5% and 7.5% per year, calculated using the same 250‑day methodology. Breaches trigger a review and rebalancing.

**Cost constraints.** Total portfolio costs must not increase overall ongoing charges by more than 0.75% per year relative to the policy baseline. Any change that violates this constraint requires client approval.

**Drawdown trigger.** If any single holding or asset sleeve falls more than 10% in a week, a drawdown review is triggered and positions may be trimmed.

**Leverage and shorting.** No leverage, no short selling, and no margin financing.

**Rebalancing.** Rebalancing is performed at least annually, or sooner if any asset class drifts by more than 5 percentage points from target or if any risk threshold is breached.

### 8. Policy Evaluation

This policy is considered successful if the projected liquid assets at 2033 remain on track to reach $10M and the retirement portfolio reaches or exceeds $5M by age 60 under the post‑house allocation. Annual checkpoints in 2028, 2030, 2032, and a post‑purchase review in 2034 will evaluate progress and trigger adjustments.

### 9. Fee Structure

Policy advisory fee: USD 2,000 per quarter, billed in arrears.

### 10. Disclaimer and Acknowledgment

This policy relies on modeled projections and expected returns that are not guaranteed. Market volatility, sequence risk, and cashflow deficits may materially affect outcomes. Sarah should review the plan annually and update it as circumstances change.
