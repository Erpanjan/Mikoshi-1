# Financial Planning Policy

**Client:** Sarah Chen  
**Date:** February 10, 2026  
**Primary Investment Focus:** House Purchase in 2033 ($10,000,000)

---

## I. Client Background

Sarah Chen is 40 years old, plans to retire at 60, and has a life expectancy assumption of 90. She supports two dependents and is in her peak earning years. Her near-term objective is to purchase a $10,000,000 home in 2033 (a 7‑year horizon from 2026), while also maintaining a retirement target of $5,000,000 at age 60. This policy focuses on funding the house purchase from liquid assets, while recognizing that retirement is intended to be funded primarily through her 401(k).

## II. Client Financial Snapshot

Sarah’s wealth is employment-derived. She earns $300,000 per year with 3% annual growth and spends $150,000 in base costs plus $60,000 in rent, also rising at 3%. Her assets total approximately $6.7M, concentrated in a $5.0M brokerage account, a $1.0M 401(k), $500k in cash, and a $200k Roth IRA. The cashflow projections use forward‑looking capital market assumptions (expected return, volatility, and correlations) and compute account‑level expected returns from each account’s asset allocation, so deterministic outcomes differ across portfolio risk settings. Baseline projections show persistent negative net cashflow that gradually draws down liquid resources over time.

## III. Client Financial Needs

The primary investment need is to accumulate $10,000,000 by 2033 from liquid assets (bank + brokerage + Roth IRA). After holding a six‑month emergency reserve of approximately $105,000, the investable base is approximately $5,595,000. Achieving $10,000,000 from $5,595,000 over 7 years requires an annualized return of approximately 8.65% before considering ongoing cashflow deficits and taxes. Under the current allocation, the liquid pool in 2033 is projected at $8,340,952, which implies a $1,659,048 shortfall against the house target. Retirement is intended to be funded from the 401(k); under the baseline projection the 401(k) balance at 2046 is $4,474,753, implying a $525,247 shortfall versus the $5M target.

We therefore recommend a risk‑controlled portfolio that is designed to meet the required return with the lowest practical level of volatility. The selected allocation targets an expected return of 8.68% with an annualized volatility of 9.42%, which satisfies the objective of meeting the return requirement while keeping risk as low as possible. After implementing that allocation, the projected liquid pool at 2033 rises to $9,660,203, reducing the shortfall to $339,797. The improvement comes with a meaningful retirement trade‑off: modeled cashflow draws more heavily on retirement accounts under the lower cash reserve, reducing the projected 401(k) balance at 2046 to $2,794,527 and widening the retirement shortfall to $2,205,473.

## IV. Client Investment Preference

Sarah’s current allocations show comfort with diversified global equity exposure, core fixed income, and modest alternatives. This supports a moderate‑to‑growth posture for the house objective, provided liquidity is managed and risks are fully disclosed. The portfolio recommendation therefore emphasizes diversification, measured risk‑taking, and a target‑return framework rather than an unconstrained pursuit of maximum return.

## V. Taxes, Exclusions and Exemptions

Tax status was not provided. This policy assumes U.S. residency and uses tax‑efficient implementation in the brokerage account. Interest‑heavy and higher‑turnover exposures should be tilted toward tax‑advantaged accounts where possible, while equities and tax‑efficient instruments are prioritized in taxable accounts. Any future tax‑residency changes should trigger a policy review.

## VI. Other Special Requirements

None provided.

## VII. Portfolio

### 1. Scope and Allocation Timeline

The scope of this policy is the liquid pool available for the house purchase: brokerage and Roth IRA balances plus the portion of bank cash in excess of a six‑month emergency reserve. The investable amount is approximately $5,595,000, with $105,000 maintained in cash for liquidity. Deployment is phased over one to three months to reduce entry‑point risk.

### 2. Governance

Investment policy is set by the advisor in consultation with Sarah, executed through the custodian, and reviewed quarterly. Annual policy reviews are required or sooner if Sarah’s goals, cashflow, or risk tolerance materially change. Asset allocation assumptions are grounded in forward‑looking capital market assumptions, and risk management accountability remains with the advisor.

### 3. Investment, Return, and Risk Objectives

The investment objective is to meet or exceed an 8.65% annualized return over seven years with the lowest volatility consistent with that return. The recommended portfolio delivers an expected return of 8.68% with 9.42% volatility, which meets the return requirement while maintaining a disciplined level of risk.

### 4. Investment Guidelines

The portfolio must remain diversified across global equities, bonds, and alternatives, maintain at least a 2% cash allocation, and prohibit leverage or short selling. Rebalancing should occur at least annually, or earlier if any asset class drifts by more than 5 percentage points from target.

### 5. Investment Strategy

The strategy is a Strategic Asset Allocation built to meet the required return while maintaining strong risk controls. The solution explicitly targets the required return and then selects the most risk‑efficient allocation that satisfies it, rather than pursuing higher returns through higher volatility.

### 6. Investment Vehicle Selection

The recommended allocation provides asset‑class weights, a balanced mix of active and passive exposure, and a set of implementable securities. The selection favors cost efficiency, liquidity, diversification, and ease of implementation while still allowing targeted active exposure where it is most justified. Active exposure is used where specialized manager skill and market inefficiencies can reasonably add value; passive exposure is used where broad market exposure and low cost are the primary goals. Vehicles are selected for daily liquidity, transparent holdings, and practical implementation in standard custodial accounts. Dollar allocations below are based on the $5,595,000 investable base.

### 7. Risk Management

Risk oversight is defined in clear, measurable terms to keep the portfolio aligned with the return objective while controlling downside risk.

**Absolute risk.** We measure absolute risk as the annualized standard deviation of simulated daily returns over the most recent 250 business days. The portfolio’s absolute risk must remain within ±2.5% of the 9.42% target volatility (acceptable range: 6.92%–11.92%). If it breaches this range, the portfolio must be rebalanced back to target.

**Tracking error.** Tracking error measures how far the portfolio’s returns deviate from its policy benchmark. It is calculated using the same 250‑day methodology. The portfolio should maintain a tracking error of at least 2.5% and no more than 7.5% per year. Breaches trigger a review and rebalancing back to policy targets.

**Cost constraints.** Total portfolio costs (including fund expense ratios and advisory costs) must not increase the portfolio’s overall ongoing charges by more than 0.75% per year relative to the policy baseline. Any implementation change that violates this constraint requires client approval.

**Drawdown trigger.** If any single holding or asset sleeve falls more than 10% in a week, a drawdown review is triggered. Positions may be trimmed or rebalanced to restore risk alignment.

**Leverage and shorting.** No leverage, no short selling, and no margin financing.

**Rebalancing.** Rebalancing is performed at least annually, or sooner if any asset class drifts by more than 5 percentage points from target or if any risk threshold is breached.

### 8. Policy Evaluation

This policy is considered successful if the projected liquid assets at 2033 remain on track to reach $10M. Annual checkpoints in 2028, 2030, and 2032 will evaluate progress and trigger adjustments. If the projected liquid pool falls materially below the required trajectory, the policy should be revisited to consider additional savings, a longer time horizon, or a reduced target amount.

### 9. Fee Structure

Policy advisory fee: USD 2,000 per quarter, billed in arrears.

### 10. Disclaimer and Acknowledgment

This policy relies on modeled projections and expected returns that are not guaranteed. Market volatility, sequence risk, and cashflow deficits may materially affect outcomes. Sarah should review the plan annually and update it as circumstances change.
