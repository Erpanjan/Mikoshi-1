# Financial Planning Policy — Option 2 (Integrated Dual‑Goal Policy)

**Client:** Sarah Chen  
**Date:** February 10, 2026  
**Primary Goal:** House Purchase in 2033 ($10,000,000)  
**Secondary Goal:** Retirement at 60 ($5,000,000)

---

## I. Client Background

Sarah Chen is 40 years old, plans to retire at 60, and has a life expectancy assumption of 90. She supports two dependents and is in her peak earning years. Her near‑term objective is to purchase a $10,000,000 home in 2033, while maintaining a $5,000,000 retirement target at age 60. This policy uses an integrated approach that treats housing and retirement as two concurrent objectives, each supported by a dedicated investment strategy aligned to its time horizon.

## II. Client Financial Snapshot

Sarah’s wealth is employment‑derived. She earns $300,000 per year with 3% annual growth and spends $150,000 in base costs plus $60,000 in rent, also rising at 3%. Her assets total approximately $6.7M, concentrated in a $5.0M brokerage account, a $1.0M 401(k), $500k in cash, and a $200k Roth IRA. Cashflow projections use forward‑looking capital market assumptions and account‑level allocations to estimate growth. Baseline projections show persistent negative net cashflow that gradually draws down liquid resources over time.

## III. Client Financial Needs

Sarah has two simultaneous needs that should be solved in parallel, with each account aligned to its purpose.

**Housing need (2033):** Accumulate $10,000,000 by 2033 from liquid assets (bank + brokerage + Roth IRA). After a six‑month reserve of approximately $105,000, the investable base is about $5,595,000. Achieving $10,000,000 over 7 years requires approximately 8.65% annualized return before considering cashflow deficits and taxes. Under the current allocation, the liquid pool in 2033 is projected at $8,340,952, implying a $1,659,048 shortfall.

**Retirement need (2046):** Fund $5,000,000 by age 60, primarily through the 401(k). Under the baseline projection the 401(k) balance at 2046 is $4,474,753, implying a $525,247 shortfall. A concurrent retirement allocation is therefore required to close the gap without relying on housing assets.

**Integrated policy approach:** The brokerage and Roth IRA are aligned to the housing objective, while the 401(k) adopts a long‑horizon growth allocation from the outset. This avoids trading off retirement funding to solve the housing goal.

**Integrated policy outcomes:**
- 2033 liquid assets: **$9,660,213** (shortfall **$339,787**).  
- 2046 401(k) balance: **$5,080,167**, exceeding the $5M target.

## IV. Client Investment Preference

Sarah’s current allocations show comfort with diversified global equity exposure, core fixed income, and modest alternatives. The integrated approach respects this preference by maintaining broad diversification, using cost‑efficient index exposure where appropriate, and employing active management only where it is justified.

## V. Taxes, Exclusions and Exemptions

Tax status was not provided. This policy assumes U.S. residency and uses tax‑efficient implementation in the brokerage account. Interest‑heavy and higher‑turnover exposures should be tilted toward tax‑advantaged accounts where possible, while equities and tax‑efficient instruments are prioritized in taxable accounts. Any future tax‑residency changes should trigger a policy review.

## VI. Other Special Requirements

None provided.

## VII. Portfolio

### 1. Scope and Allocation Timeline

The policy allocates two portfolios in parallel:

**Housing Portfolio (brokerage + Roth IRA):** A risk‑controlled allocation designed to meet the 2033 house goal with the lowest practical volatility.

**Retirement Portfolio (401k):** A higher‑growth allocation designed to improve the long‑term retirement trajectory without drawing on housing assets.

### 2. Governance

Investment policy is set by the advisor in consultation with Sarah, executed through the custodian, and reviewed quarterly. Annual policy reviews are required or sooner if Sarah’s goals, cashflow, or risk tolerance materially change. Asset allocation assumptions are grounded in forward‑looking capital market assumptions, and risk management accountability remains with the advisor.

### 3. Investment, Return, and Risk Objectives

**Housing portfolio objective:** Meet or exceed an 8.65% annualized return over seven years with controlled volatility. The recommended allocation targets an expected return of **8.68%** with **9.42%** volatility.

**Retirement portfolio objective:** Achieve long‑term growth consistent with the longer horizon to age 60. The recommended allocation targets an expected return of **9.60%** with **10.96%** volatility and is projected to reach $5.08M by 2046.

### 4. Investment Guidelines

The portfolios must remain diversified across global equities, bonds, and alternatives, maintain at least a 2% cash allocation, and prohibit leverage or short selling. Rebalancing should occur at least annually, or earlier if any asset class drifts by more than 5 percentage points from target.

### 5. Investment Strategy

The housing portfolio is built to meet the required return with disciplined risk controls. The retirement portfolio is built for long‑term growth and is more equity‑tilted due to the longer horizon.

### 6. Investment Vehicle Selection

The recommended allocations provide asset‑class weights, a balanced mix of active and passive exposure, and implementable securities. The selection favors cost efficiency, liquidity, diversification, and ease of implementation. Active exposure is used where specialized manager skill and market inefficiencies can reasonably add value; passive exposure is used where broad market exposure and low cost are the primary goals.

### 7. Risk Management

Risk oversight is defined in clear, measurable terms to keep the portfolios aligned with their objectives.

**Housing portfolio — absolute risk.** Target volatility 9.42%, acceptable range 6.92%–11.92%. Breaches require rebalancing.

**Retirement portfolio — absolute risk.** Target volatility 10.96%, acceptable range 8.46%–13.46%. Breaches require rebalancing.

**Tracking error.** For both portfolios, tracking error versus the policy benchmark must remain between 2.5% and 7.5% per year, calculated using the same 250‑day methodology. Breaches trigger a review and rebalancing.

**Cost constraints.** Total portfolio costs must not increase overall ongoing charges by more than 0.75% per year relative to the policy baseline. Any change that violates this constraint requires client approval.

**Drawdown trigger.** If any single holding or asset sleeve falls more than 10% in a week, a drawdown review is triggered and positions may be trimmed.

**Leverage and shorting.** No leverage, no short selling, and no margin financing.

**Rebalancing.** Rebalancing is performed at least annually, or sooner if any asset class drifts by more than 5 percentage points from target or if any risk threshold is breached.

### 8. Policy Evaluation

This policy is considered successful if the projected liquid assets at 2033 remain on track to reach $10M and the 401(k) balance reaches or exceeds $5M by 2046 under the integrated allocation. Annual checkpoints in 2028, 2030, 2032, and 2034 will evaluate progress and trigger adjustments.

### 9. Fee Structure

Policy advisory fee: USD 2,000 per quarter, billed in arrears.

### 10. Disclaimer and Acknowledgment

This policy relies on modeled projections and expected returns that are not guaranteed. Market volatility, sequence risk, and cashflow deficits may materially affect outcomes. Sarah should review the plan annually and update it as circumstances change.
