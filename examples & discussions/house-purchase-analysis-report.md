## Appendix: Calculation Details

### Required CAGR Calculation

```
Initial Capital:  $7,000,000
Target Amount:    $10,000,000
Timeline:         5 years

Required CAGR = (Target / Initial)^(1/years) - 1
             = (10,000,000 / 7,000,000)^(1/5) - 1
             = (1.4286)^0.2 - 1
             = 7.39%
```

### Portfolio Expected Return

The recommended RP3 (Moderate) portfolio has an expected return of **8.89%**, which exceeds the required 7.39% by **1.50 percentage points**, providing a safety margin.

### Terminal Value Projection

```
Year 5 Value = Initial × (1 + Return)^Years
            = $7,000,000 × (1.0889)^5
            = $7,000,000 × 1.5311
            = $10,717,752
```
