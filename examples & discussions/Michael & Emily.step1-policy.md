# Carter Family Strategic Wealth Policy

This policy outlines a comprehensive wealth management strategy for Michael and Emily Carter to achieve retirement readiness by age 62 and fund their son Noah's future education. The strategy transitions the household from a bifurcated, concentrated asset structure (100% US Equity in taxable and 100% US Treasury in tax-deferred) to a globally diversified, risk-optimized portfolio. By reallocating $675,000 in existing assets, the plan maintains a 100% success probability for core goals while improving tax efficiency and household-level discipline.

## Client Background

Michael Carter (36) and Emily Carter (34) are residents of Austin, Texas. Michael has stable employment with predictable compensation growth. Emily works part-time as a pediatric nurse. They have one child, Noah (1). The family is focused on long-term stability, education funding, and retirement security.

## Client Financial Needs

1. Retirement Readiness: Target retirement at age 62 with lifestyle continuity.\n2. Education Funding: Support future college costs for Noah; specific numerical targets for in-state vs. out-of-state costs are currently undefined and require future quantification.\n3. Emergency Reserve: Maintain 6-9 months of core spending ($64,800 - $97,200).

## Client Investment Preferences and Behavioral Considerations

The clients seek to avoid over-concentration risk and improve household-level allocation discipline. There is a strong preference for improving tax efficiency by optimizing asset placement across taxable and tax-deferred accounts. The household demonstrates high capacity for risk given stable income and long horizons, but requires a structured framework to prevent reactive decision-making.

## Taxes, Exclusions, and Exemptions

As U.S. citizens residing in Texas, the clients are not subject to state income tax. Investment strategy focuses on federal tax efficiency, utilizing the 401(k) for tax-inefficient assets and the taxable brokerage for long-term capital gains efficiency. No specific asset exclusions or religious exemptions were noted.

## Other Special Requirements

The plan must preserve the current lifestyle while ensuring the 6-9 month emergency reserve remains liquid. The mortgage at 3.375% is considered low-interest debt and is not a priority for accelerated repayment.
